                    <h2>Hi, I'm Drew.</h2>
                    <p>I currently live in San Jose, California. </p>
                    <p>I love to keep physically fit. Weight lifting has been one of my favorite ways of relieving
                        stress.</p>
                    <p>I also love to ride my motorcycle. Sometimes when you’re leaning into turns, it feels like you're
                        flying.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>I'm a recruit in Thinkful's Software Engeering Bootcamp.</h3>
                <p>I chose <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They have an ISA with living stipend</li>
                    <li>1 on 1 mentoring</li>
                    <li>Job guarantee</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I have many different facets. I have worked as a Makeup-artist and Hairstylist in cosmetology, to
                    working one of the dirtiest jobs in the world: a Pipe-fitter for sewage plants. My latest venture
                    was building cars at Tesla.</p>
                <p>Back when myspace was still around, I would stay up for hours learning about HTML and designing my
                    page. I think its fun. Time flies when you’re having fun. </p>
                <p>There's unlimited amount of documentation and resources on how to solve a problem. You can solve
                    anything if you just know where to look. The best way is working in a team. They can see things from
                    a different perspective, and maybe see things that you may have over looked. When working in a team,
                    communication is key to getting the job done efficiently. I would like my future endeavors to be
                    part of a team.</p>
