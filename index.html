                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I currently live in San Jose, a city part of the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
                <p>I have many different facets. I have worked as a Makeup-artist and Hairstylist in cosmetology, to working one of the dirtiest jobs in the world: a Pipe-fitter for sewage plants. My latest venture was building cars at Tesla.</p>
                <p>I love to keep physically fit. Weight lifting has been one of my favorite ways of relieving stress.</p>
                <p>I also love to ride my motorcycle. Sometimes when youâ€™re leaning into turns, it feels like you're flying.</p>
